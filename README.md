# Socket-Programming

Implementation of socket connections between client server in C and python. Also further implemented two different
types of HTTP connections (persistent and non-persistent) in python. 

## INSTRUCTIONS:

**Note: The files that can be requested from the server can be found in the Data folder in the server folders. Ex:- [Link to Data folder in C folder](./C/Server/Data)**

### For running the C version
- Run the server in the terminal by running "./server" 
- Run the client in a separate terminal by running "./client"
- The files will automatically get downloaded into client folder.

### For running the Python version
Server and client for both persistent and non persistent HTTP connections have been implemented.
- Run any one of the servers by running either "python3 server_persistent.py" or "python3 server_nonpersistent".
- Run the corresponding client by running either "python3 client_persistent.py" or "python3 client_nonpersistent".
- Enter the number of files to be obtained.
- Enter the name of the required files one by one.
